These dotfiles for my fedora server installation.

Thanks for Chris Titus for the original files: https://github.com/ChrisTitusTech/Fedora-Titus

The aim is to have a minimal fedora installation with bspwm window manager.
The main reason is to learn linux and handle config files.

The install.sh script will install the software and fonts needed.
Not perfect yet but all works fine. 

Thanks for reading :)
